  "description": "The theme of all three of my drawings will be the desire to escape reality. I hope to make the viewer forget about whatever is happening in their life and allow them to become absorbed in the virtual world that stands before them. In the first drawing I will create an endless looping highway lined with neon lights and city buildings with the point of view centered so that it appears the viewer is riding on this highway. The backdrop for this piece will be a technologically advanced city. However, the viewer will never make it to the city in the distance and instead ride on the empty highway before them for eternity. In this piece the goal is to elicit nostalgia (for the 80s) and a sense of freedom (driving on an empty highway at midnight with only you behind the wheel). To do this I will use the three.js library for the lighting features and 3d objects and I will also use javascript for animation (to liven up the environment). The second drawing will be an endless loop in a space. The point of view will be centered such that the user takes on the roll of a space explorer flying through the depths of space. The goal of this piece is to elicit the desire to explore and also excite the viewer about a future time where technology has become so advanced that even a common citizen can space travel. I also want to the evoke the feeling of tranquility. To do this I will use three.js and javascript. I will need to make planets, so I will be using three.js (CubeMaping) to build the 3d planets in the environment (and to add textures to them), and to design other parts of the environment. I will use javascript for animation. The third drawing will center around a translucent portal in the middle of the screen. The world outside of the portal will be very dystopian while paradise lies on the other side of the portal. This environment will also be run on an endless loop, juxtaposing environments that embody paradise and dystopia. Although the viewer will be able to see paradise through the portal, they will never reach the portal and find out if paradise truly lies on the other side. The goal is to elicit curiosity and the desire to escape to the unknown. To do this I will again use three.js (or html canvas if I decide to make the environment 2d) and javascript for animation. Together, all three pieces will immerse the viewer, allowing them to escape reality and evoke feelings such as nostalgia, curiosity, freedom, and the desire to explore.",
